Due to the decision to use Express and Node on the backend for the app, a simple upload to Expo Snack was not possible. It only supports the front end. I have uploaded it anyway so you are able to see the front end files. To see the funcionality of the backend incorporated and to actually be able to manoeuvre around the application, please see the youtube video provided as well as the source code for the project to run locally if necessary. 

The Expo Snack link is here:

Again, please note this will not display all the functionality as Expo Snack does not support incorporation with the backend. It does, however, contian all the front end component code and will display the app loading.

In case it is helpful, please see the Expo update link here:

Backend funcitonality is managed via Express server and Node.js, both this and the database (sqlite3 database) are found in the server directory.

Database can be accessed using the following command from /db directory:
sqlite3 bujjit.db

Express server can be started from server directory using the following command: 
node app.js
